#productivity-tools#
 
These are just some productivity tools I use day to day at my support job.  Mostly ticket and todo list integration with Kayako and Remember The Milk.

* ticketcount - a kayako ticket counter I use to display tickets in my wm's statusbar.
* rtmann.py - Announces upcoming events from an ical to irc.  Run from cron with external bot announce script.
* scrumomatic.py - pukes out wiki markup for my daily scrum notes from RememberTheMilk
